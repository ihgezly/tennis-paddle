## Notes on Payload E-commerce

Payload is a powerful CMS, and the e-commerce plugin gives you many features out of the box.

However, in real production use you may need to customize parts of it.

For example:

- Slug field was customized to properly support non-Latin characters.
- Image upload hook converts images to WebP and resizes them automatically for optimized performance and reduced bandwidth usage.
- Some behaviors are opinionated and may require collection overrides.

This starter already includes structural adjustments to make it more production-ready.

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router) + **React 19** + **Payload CMS 3** + **PostgreSQL**
- **Tailwind CSS 4** + **React Icons** + **next-intl** + **radix-ui** + **React Hook Form**
- **pnpm** as package manager (Node >= 22)

### Data Layer, Caching & Revalidation

The project uses a simple DAL (Data Access Layer) abstraction.

You can choose the implementation in:

[`src/lib/core/dal/Pages.ts`](src/lib/core/dal/index.ts)

- **Api** → Headless REST mode (recommended for production)
- **Queries** → Direct Payload SDK mode (monolith)

Both expose the same public methods.

---

### Caching & Revalidation

- The frontend uses Next.js cache with tag-based revalidation. Products and categories auto-revalidate on save or delete. The storefront is aggressively cached for performance.
- After changing products, categories, layout, footer or sitemap, click **“Revalidate” in Admin → Site Settings** to refresh immediately.
- Draft mode is supported — preview content does not affect the published cache.

### Orders & Notifications

- On order creation, a confirmation email is automatically sent to the customer.
- A WhatsApp notification is sent to the store owner via Callmebot.
- The architecture is ready for store pickup flow.
- Payment gateway integration can be added easily (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) using order hooks.

### Local Development

Clone the repo and start a local PostgreSQL with Docker:

```bash
docker run --name payload-ecommerce \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=admin \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=payload \
  -p 5443:5432 \
  -v payload_ecommerce_data:/var/lib/postgresql \
  -d postgres:18
```

Create a `.env` file based on [`.env.example`](.env.example) and configure your environment variables, then install and run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

To seed mock data for local development, run the [`seeder script`](seed/index.ts):

```bash
pnpm seed
```

### Key Directories

- `src/app/(app)/` — Public storefront (home, product, category, checkout, preview)
- `src/app/(payload)/` — Payload admin + API routes
- `src/lib/` — Core app logic (collections, queries, caching, types, utilities, providers, i18n)
- `src/lib/collections/` — Payload CMS collection definitions (Products, Category, Media, Users, Orders, etc.)
- `src/components/` — UI + domain components (cart, checkout, product, layout, shared, ui)
